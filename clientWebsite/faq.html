        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <h2>Who is Hayes and is this a new company?</h2>
        <p>Hayes Handpiece company started in California over 30 years ago and now have 85 locations in 5 countries. It started as
        and still is a Family owned business that specializes in handpiece repairs. In Canada, Hayes has multiple locations and
        has been serving Dentist for over 15 years!</p>

        <h2>How many highspeed handpieces per chair is recommended?</h2>
        <p>Most manufacturers suggest 3 high speeds per chair. One in the patientâ€™s mouth, one in the sterilizer, and one cooling
        down after being sterilized.</p>

        <h2>Why do my Handpieces break down so often?</h2>
        <p>This can be tough to answer because there are so many factors that can contribute to frequent repairs. We suggest
        watching our video click here for the major reasons why handpieces break down often.</p>

        <h2>Is it worth it to fix my Handpieces?</h2>
        <p>In most cases yes. A good quality handpiece usually cost hundreds and very often over a thousand to purchase new. Any of
        the big well known brand names such as Kavo, Star, Midwest, NSK, W&H, Bien Air, Sirona, Siemens, Scican and Morita are
        worth to fix. Most highspeed repairs can be fixed between $200-$300 which is much cheaper then purchasing new.</p>

        <h2>How long should my highspeed handpiece last between repairs?</h2>
        <p>For Highspeed handpieces it is normal to do a repair each year. On average, a repair will usually last 10-16 months if
        the handpiece is well maintained and you have enough handpieces.</p>

        <h2>Why are burs slipping out as I run my Handpiece?</h2>
        <p>This is an indication that your chuck is weak and the Turbine needs to be replaced. A weak chuck will only get worse and
        burs can potentially slip out into the patients mouth. Your handpiece would need to be serviced ASAP.</p>

        <h2>Is it safe to buy new handpieces off EBay?</h2>
        <p>No. Almost all of the handpieces for sell on Ebay are Fake copies of major brand names and the ones that are not copies
        are very low quality made in Asia handpieces that are not approved by Health Canada. These handpieces can be very
        dangerous to patients. There are reported cases of burs falling out into patients mouths and the push button back caps
        exploding in patients mouth. In the case of Electric handpieces, there is a very real risk of the handpiece heating up
        and burning the patient. It is always recommended to buy reputable handpieces from a reputable dealer.</p>

        <h2>My technician suggested for me to check my air pressure, what does it mean?</h2>
        <p>This is in reference to the air pressure at the chair and the handpiece tubing. Most air driven handpieces are designed
        to work with a maximum air pressure between 32-40psi. Anything over this will damage the handpiece bearings and cause
        the handpiece to prematurely break, in some cases it can cause the handpiece to break down in just a few days or weeks.
        Most chair built in air pressure gauges are not accurate. In order to verify it properly, the air pressure needs to be
        taken from the handpiece tube right before it goes into the handpiece. This is done using a inline air pressure gauge
        that threads directly on the tube.</p>

        <h2>Is it ok to cool down my handpiece with cold water?</h2>
        <p>NO! Never do this. Handpieces are made with metal and tiny components. During the sterilization process the handpiece
        heats up causing the metal to expand. It needs to cool down naturally. Cooling down with cold water is a shock to the
        metal and components and will cause the handpiece to break down prematurely. If you find yourself doing this often, it
        is an indication that you need more handpieces.</p>

        <h2>Is it ok to skip the dry cycle and store my handpieces wet?</h2>
        <p>NO! Never do this. Handpieces are made with metal and tiny components. If you store the handpieces in a wet
        sterilization pouch the water will be absorbed by the handpiece causing it to rust. It will also prematurely cause the
        handpiece to break more often.</p>

        <h2>Does Hayes ever use Chinese components to do repairs?</h2>
        <p>NO! Never! At Hayes we only use the best components on the market. All our bearings are German made and are equivalent
        or exceed the manufacturers original bearings. Most of our aftermarket Turbines are also made in Germany and that is why
        we can offer a 1 year warranty. O-rings and other small parts are mostly made in the USA.</p>
