            <h2>Brief</h2>
            <p>This is a website I had to create for my Web 4 class during the winter semester of 2023. The task was to create a single page website (english & french) promoting an amusement park, museum, or public institution. The website would promote the upcoming activities for the season to come and give all the relevant and important information.</p>

        <div id="solution">
            <h2>Solution / Process</h2>
            <p>The way I approached this project is by first analyzing the actual website for Six Flags Over Texas. I took note of there style, fonts, colors, etc. and used them for this website. For the API features that are implemented in the website like the guestbook / comment section, I used <a href="https://onsen.io" target="_blank">Onsen.io</a> to help with the process. Lastly, the solution for the language switching function is simple but not very efficitent. I simply created two versions of the same website but in the different languages and linked them to each other.</p>

        <div id="learnings">
            <h2>Learnings</h2>
            <p>What I learned by completing this porject is how to use and edit API's like Onsen.io and how to gather the most important information and showcase it in a logical way. I had to read over all the different pages on the official website and decid what information should be included in mine.</p>

        <div id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, the website functions as intended and is easy to navigate. It also fits in with the style of the actual Six Flags Over Texas website and provides the proper information that was requested for this project. Some things that can be improved upon are the responsiveness and readability while viewing it on a phone, the language switching funtion can be coded differently and more efficiently, and some subtle animations would go a long way in making the site feel more complete.</p>
